# Minimal Fighting Game Prototype

This is a minimal 2-player fighting game prototype using Phaser 3. Characters are simple colored rectangles with basic movement, jump, attack, health bars and knockback. No art assets required.

Controls:
- Player 1: A = left, D = right, W = jump, S = attack
- Player 2: ← = left, → = right, ↑ = jump, ↓ = attack
- First to reduce opponent health to 0 wins.

How to run:
1. Clone or save files to a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox).
   - For some browsers you may need to run a local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server`).
3. Play!

Next steps we can do after this prototype:
- Add sprite animations (idle/walk/attack/hurt)
- Implement combo detection and special moves
- Add blocking, crouch, hitstun, and frame data tuning
- Add menus, character select, rounds and scoring
- Add networked multiplayer (websockets) or gamepad support
- Add art, sound effects and music

Tell me your preferred platform, art style, and which features to add next and I’ll continue.
